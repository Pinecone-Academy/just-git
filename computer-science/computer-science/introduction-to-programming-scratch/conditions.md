# Conditions

And last time, we took a look at values, pieces of information that are stored inside of our Scratch programs that we could use inside of those programs.

Today we'll take that idea one step further and take a look at how we can use information inside of our Scratch programs to make decisions by asking questions, and then deciding what to do based on the answer to those questions.
