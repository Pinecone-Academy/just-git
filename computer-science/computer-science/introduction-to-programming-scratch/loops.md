# Loops

We've seen functions that perform some sort of task. We've seen values that hold information, like what direction the sprite is facing, or what position it is, or how big or how small it is, for example. And last time we took a look at conditions, the ability for our Scratch programs to ask questions and then make decisions based on the answers to those questions. But through all of this, every time we run the code, every time we press the green flag or press the space bar inside of our Scratch program, everything, every block of code, is just running one time.

We're running through the code, top to bottom, one time. And if we want to see the program run again, we have to press the green flag again, or press the space bar again, or make something else to trigger the rest of the blocks to run.

This time what we're going to take a look at is the ability of Scratch programs to loop, to repeat some blocks multiple times, as computers will do quite often.
