# Variables

So far, in Scratch, we've seen our Scratch programs use a variety of different values.

Values that keep track of what direction a sprite is pointing in, or how big, or how small the sprite is. Where it is, for example. And these are all pieces of information stored inside of our Scratch program that we can use later in our program to make decisions, or to make our program behave in different ways.

But sometimes, as our programs get a little bit more complex, we will want to store other pieces of information inside of our program as well where we decide what information gets stored in our program, and how we use that information later on.

And we're going to start to call these variables in the world of programming.

And today, we'll explore variables in Scratch, and how it is that we can use them. So I'll go ahead and open up Scratch here as we have before. And there's one tab here that we haven't looked at yet, which is this Variables tab. And a variable you can think of as just some value.

Some container inside of our Scratch program that's going to store some information. Information that we might be able to use later inside of our program as well.

### Example

**Counting cat**

* Increase the number by 1 when you click on the cat
* Reset the counter by pressing the reset button

{% endfile %}

### Challenge

**Chase the Star**

If the score reaches 10, the game ends with a changing backdrop that you win!
