# Introduction to Scratch

We're going to be exploring Scratch, which is a visual block-based programming language developed by the team over at MIT's Media Lab.&#x20;

Using Scratch, by putting together little Scratch puzzle pieces, that we'll see shortly, you'll be able to build visual stories and animations and games and other programs that you'll be able to share with others. And along the way, as we're exploring Scratch, you'll be introduced to the fundamentals of programming.

We'll take a look at concepts like functions and loops and conditions and variables and other types of ideas that you'll see in programming.

And even though the Scratch programming language looks a little bit different, it uses blocks instead of the more traditional text-based programming that you might see in other programming languages later, really Scratch is based on the same fundamental ideas. And it's going to use the same principles of computational thinking.

To create a game, interactive story, animation or artwork in Scratch, you must add code to tell a **Sprite** exactly what to do. A **Sprite** is an object that performs actions in a project.  A sprite will follow your commands and the Scratch editor automatically starts with a **Cat Sprite** for all projects.&#x20;

You can add new **Sprites**, delete a **Sprite** and see all of the **Sprites** that you’ve added to your project in the **Sprites Pane**. Any sprites added will appear on the **Stage**.

The **Stage** is the area where you will see your code come to life. Think of this area just like a Broadway stage that actors perform on. This is where the **Sprites** will follow the coded commands that you have put together in the **Code Area**. It is the background of your project and you can personalize it by adding different **Backdrops** from the **Backdrops** Library.

You will tell the **Sprites** exactly what to do by giving them commands that are put together into a program. A command is an instruction to do a particular task, and those are shown in the form of Code Blocks in the **Blocks Palette**, which is located under the Code tab at the top left of the screen. You can think of this area as your toolbox. All of the blocks are colour-coded and can be found in the categories on the very left side of the Blocks Palette. As you can see in the following picture, all of the **Motion** code blocks are dark blue and can be accessed by clicking on the blue Motion category.&#x20;

A program is a group of commands listed together in a specific order. Think of a program like the steps you must follow in a cookbook to bake a cake.  You will build your program by choosing code blocks from the toolbox (**Blocks Palette**) and dragging them into the **Code Area.** You can think of this area as your **Sprite**’s empty brain where you will drag instructions for it to follow so that it can run them on the **Stage**. The blocks can be clipped together to make a script, and just like the steps to baking a cake, or the script for an actor to follow in a play, the order of the blocks is very important.&#x20;

To start your program or to test your code click the **Green Flag** located above the **Stage** and to stop your program click the **Red Stop Sign**.&#x20;

You can make your **Stage** full-screen by clicking the button with the four arrows in the top right corner above the **Stage**.&#x20;

Finally, once you’ve finished your creation you can save it by clicking on **File** > **Save To Your Computer**.&#x20;

Now You’re ready to begin a Scratch Project!&#x20;
