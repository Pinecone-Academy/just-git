And last time we took a look at the fundamentals of programming putting together a sequence of instructions that we called Functions by assembling these different colored Scratch blocks. And by putting together these different colored Scratch blocks, we were able to bring our projects to life.

We were able to take characters, or sprites, on the stage, and have them move around, or draw pictures, and play sound, and more. And so today, let's take those concepts of programming and build upon them a little bit more.
