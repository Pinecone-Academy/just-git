# Values

And last time we took a look at Events, things that can happen--

like us pressing the green flag, or clicking a button, or pressing a key on the keyboard-- and letting

&#x20;our Scratch project respond to those events. And how do they respond?

&#x20;Well, they respond with Functions, those blocks that we stacked on top of each other to let our sprites or the stage respond in some way.
