# Values

And last time we took a look at Events, things that can happen like us pressing the green flag, or clicking a button, or pressing a key on the keyboard and letting our Scratch project respond to those events. And how do they respond?

Well, they respond with Functions, those blocks that we stacked on top of each other to let our sprites or the stage respond in some way.
